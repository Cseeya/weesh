# HolyUnblocked

This is a website that unblocks multiple games, plugins, etc.. This website can not be seen by GoGuardian if you download and use the site locally. It can be seen if you use my replit domain. Some games uses embeds so if those embedded sites get blocked we will have to find a new site.

This of course is a great way of using it but if you want to make sure your Teacher can't see the website start by doing this!

- Start by clicking this link [Download](https://github.com/TTheHolyOne/holyunblocked/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) 

- After doing this all you have to do is open index.html or any other HTML file you want!
- I recommend bookmarking the home page so it isnt annoying to get to it again

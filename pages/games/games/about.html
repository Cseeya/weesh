			How to use: Basically all you need to do is find a game you want to play and
			Click it! Technically it can be blocked because it is embedded but GoGuardian
			can't see it and it uses the same games that you will find on your favorite
			gaming sites! Does not use the same style as the other pages because it
			makes it easier to hide when it's black and pinkish purple. Says google classroom and
			the icon is too to hide it as well! We also use ruffle.js for flash games because after 2020 december Flash Player no longer exists :(<br/>

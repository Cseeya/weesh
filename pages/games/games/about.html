			How to use: Basically all you need to do is find a game you want to play and
			click it! Techinally it can be blocked because it is embedded but goguardian
			cant see it and it uses the same games that you will find on your favorite
			gaming sites! Does not use the same style as the other pages because it
			makes it easier to hide when its black and red. Says google classroom and
			the icon is it too to hide it as well!
